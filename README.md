# Surveillance of Coronavirus COVID-2019
This repository takes the data collected by John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) and further processes it to expand the dashboard done by the university. This repository's dashboard includes the addition of:
- historical data
- map of death count
- geographical controls over time series chart

### Data Pipeline
Tableau Public has limited options for connecting to live data, and Google Spreadsheet is one of the free tools that can support a live dashboard. Therefore, the final destination of the pipeline will be at Google Spreadsheet.
